# Ecosystem
Undergraduate project of the course: "Introduction to C++".  
Simulation of an Ecosystem with GUI by QT Creator.

Ecosystem is composed by a terrrain of tiles SIZExSIZE. Every tile can be one of the following kinds of "ground":

1. Water
2. Hill
3. Mountain

At every kind of "ground" lives one plant and many animals. 


Simulation starts certain season of the year  **dayOfYear** .
Ecosystem runs for day 1 to runDays and every 90 days Season changes.
When is the right time plants and animals growth through *growthPlants* & *growthAnimals* functions.
Then every hour of the day animals move and eat.
At the end of the day we check if there is a hungry animal and we check for dead animals in oreder to move them from the terrain.
When is the right time plants and animals breed through *PlantBreeding* & *AnimalBreeding* functions.
